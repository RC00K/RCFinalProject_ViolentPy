# **INF601 - Advanced Programing in Python**
Ryder Cook
## **Final Project**
## _Description_
Using python for hacking and web automation task has become more frequent due to the ability 
to write complex tasks using the vast number of open-source libraries available to python. 
Staying within the scope of hacking and web automation I am going to use Scapy, and ipify API to accomplish task such 
as Network Analyzing, Port Scanning, and IP Location Finding.

However, I also plan to use Flask to create a web framework 
that will allow for users to perform these tasks online from a graphic interface rather than the normal use of a command line. 
I plan to use techniques used in violent python to create this tool as well as expanding on a previous python project that 
I developed to do similar tasks. 

This project will have the ability to operate over any web browser which will allow for multiple OS to utilize the tool. 
For the inner working of the web framework, I am going to use Bootstrap which will allow for faster front-end development, 
so I can focus on the back end and getting the python to function and behave. 

By the end of the project, I hope to have an interface that is built like a dashboard that has all the tools available in one place.
